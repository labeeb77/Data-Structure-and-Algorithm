Contents:
- Array: Implementation of a dynamic array that allows efficient resizing and random access.
- Linked List: Implementation of a singly linked list with operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.
- Stack: Implementation of a stack using both array and linked list representations.
- Queue: Implementation of a queue using arrays and linked lists, with support for both FIFO and priority queue behavior.
- Binary Tree: Implementation of a binary tree with basic operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.
- Hash Table: Implementation of a hash table with collision resolution using separate chaining.
- Heap: Implementation of a binary heap, including both min heap and max heap variations.
- Graph: Implementation of a graph using adjacency lists, along with common graph algorithms like breadth-first search (BFS) and depth-first search (DFS).

Feel free to explore the individual files, examine the code, and experiment with different data structures. Contributions and improvements are welcome, so if you have any suggestions or additional implementations, please feel free to open a pull request. Happy coding!
